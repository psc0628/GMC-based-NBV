Thanks for https://github.com/irvingvasquez/nbv-net.
<br>
This is the retrianed NBV-Net network on the HB dataset under 14 sphere candidate views.
<br>
nbv_14_HB.pth.tar is the pre-trained network file.
<br>
all_name.txt contains inference object names.
<br>
pack.3.14.txt contains 14 sphere views.
<br>
run_test_5views.py is the inference file with the NBV system.
<br>
Some folders need to be created: data, log, run_time.
