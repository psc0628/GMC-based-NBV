# GMC-based-NBV
This is our GMC method with a NBV simulation system, supporting our paper "A Global Generalized Maximum Coverage-based Solution to the Non-model-based View Planning Problem for Object Reconstruction". The basic system can be accessed by https://github.com/psc0628/NBV-Simulation. Codes of proposed methods are coming soon.
