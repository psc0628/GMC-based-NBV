# GMC-based-NBV
  This is a repository for supporting our paper "A Global Generalized Maximum Coverage-based Solution to the Non-model-based View Planning Problem for Object Reconstruction" (DOI: Coming soon).

  This GMC method is a somehow imporved version of our previous work Max-Flow-based method: "A Global Max-flow-based Multi-resolution Next-best-view Method for Reconstruction of 3D Unknown Objects" (doi: 10.1109/LRA.2021.3132430, Codes: https://github.com/psc0628/NBV-Simulation).
